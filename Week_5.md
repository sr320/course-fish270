#12. Animal energetics and thermal biology
- Review 
  - Basic concepts on homeostasis and temperature
  - How does body size affects animal physiology? (Ch 42, pp 850-853). Body size has a pervasive effect on how animal function. This concept was introduced in the first lecture: Introduction to aquatic physiology
    - Surface area/volume relationship (refresh concepts on feeding and gas exchange structures)
    - Comparing mice and elephants: differences in mass specific metabolic rate
    - Changes during development
    - As animals gets larger, its volume increases much faster than its surface does
      - Case study: Newly hatched salmon can breathe through their skin and through their gills (Ch 42, pp 852, Fig. 42.11)
      - Specific heat capacity of water (see videos in link of interest)
- Some basic concepts on thermal biology
  - Why temperature is important?
    - Temperature regulation is one of the most variable and noticeable form of homeostasis
    - There are enzymes within all cells that require optimal temperatures for them to remain functional
    - If the body temperature goes outside of the acceptable range, the cells will not be able to perform their chemical reactions
    - In addition, if the contents of a cell freeze, ice crystals can form inside the cell, which will damage the cellular structures
- How do animals regulate their body temperature? (Ch 42, pp 854-858)
  - Heat flows “downhill”, from regions of higher temperature to regions of low temperature
    - If an individual is warmer than its surrounding, it will lose heat
    - If an individual is colder than its surrounding, it will gain heat
- Mechanisms of heat exchange (Fig. 42.14)
	  - Conduction
	  - Convection
	  - Radiation
	  - Evaporation 
- Balanced equation: Heat storage = Total heat production ± Heat exchange by radiation ± Heat exchange by conduction and convection - Heat exchange by evaporation. Note: in aquatic environments, there is not evaporation and no significant radiation source (infrared radiation is rapidly absorbed in water). This leaves the equation: Heat storage = Total heat production ± Heat exchange by conduction and convection

- Variation in thermoregulation (Ch 42, pp 855-858)
	- How animals obtain heat
		- Endotherm, produce adequate heat to warm its own tissues
		- Ectotherm, relies principally on heat gained from the environment
	- Whether body temperature is constant
		- Homeotherm, keep their body temperature constant
		- Heterotherm (or poikilotherm), allow their body temperature to rise or fall depending on the environment
		- Note: some authors refer to heterotherms as those animals which USUALLY keep a constant body temperature, but have specific periods where temperature is different (e.g., hibernation), while poikilotherms are those whose temperature changes according (and strictly) to the environment.
	- Range of temperature that tolerates
    - Eurytherm
		- Stenotherm (see The physiology of climate change, in links of interest)
- Strict endotherm, ectotherm, homeotherm or heterotherm are extreme, many animals fall somewhere in between. Some examples: dessert-adapted mammals, naked moles, Japanese honeybees (see examples in pp 855-856. An extreme case is the Japanese honeybees which kill predators using heat, this is called facultative endothermy)
- How animals survive to winter? 
  - Strategy: torpor and hibernation vs. migration vs. adaptation
		- Ectotherms may become dormant. Dormancy is NOT hibernation. Fish are ectothermic, and so, by definition, cannot hibernate because they cannot actively down-regulate their body temperature or their metabolic rate. However, they can experience decreased metabolic rates associated with colder environments and/or low oxygen availability (hypoxia) and can experience dormancy
- Contrasting adaptive strategies: endothermy vs. ectothermy (Ch 42, pp 856)
  - The major advantage of endothermy over ectothermy is decreased vulnerability to fluctuations in external temperature. Regardless of location (and hence external temperature), endothermy maintains a constant core temperature for optimum enzyme activity
  - Endotherms can warm themselves because their basal metabolic rates are extremely high. Mammals and birds retain this heat because they have elaborated insulate structures as feathers, fur or massive amounts of insulating fat (as we will explain later in marine mammals)
  - Ectotherms can also generate heat as a by-product of metabolism, but the amount of heat that they produce is small compared with the amount generated by endotherms
  - To fuel their high metabolic rates, endotherms have to obtain large amount of energy-rich food. The energy to produce heat is unavailable to other process such as reproduction or growth Food+O2=Heat+H2O+CO2
  - In contrast, ectotherms can thrive with much lower intake of food, and because they are not oxidizing food to provide heat, they can use a higher proportion of their energy to support reproduction and growth
  - Downside of ectothermy: Chemical reaction rates are temperature-dependent, so muscle activity and digestion slow as the body temperature of an ectotherm drops. Q10 temperature coefficient
- What happens in the aquatic environment?
  - Water is a “heat sink”: The high thermal conductivity and heat capacity of water compared with air promotes elevated rates of heat loss through conductive and convective pathways. This is due to the hydrogen bonding (Ch 2, pp 27-28)
  - Considering the balance equation, there is not evaporation and no significant radiation source (infrared radiation is rapidly absorbed in water). So for endotherms, either total heat production must be increased, or conductive loss must be minimized
  - Endothermy in aquatic animals (mammals)
	  - Lower temperature differential: typical mammalian 36-38 C vs. cetaceans 35.5 C
	  - Generally occur while diving
	  - Lower body temp reduce O2 consumption (hypometabolism)
	  - Promotes longer dives time
	  - Increase body size (surface area /volume ratio)- Because of the high thermal conductivity and high heat capacity of water, a small animal loses heat rapidly and has no chance of attaining a body temperature very different form the medium
	  - Increase metabolism heat (heat production)
	  - Increase insulation (reduce conductance)
	  - Blubber layer: sheet of adipose tissue reinforced by collagen and elastic fibers
	  - Density or length of hair (sea other 125,000 hairs per cm2)
	  - Hair = air = insulation, requires grooming
    - Vascular specialization
      - Countercurrent heat exchanger (see gray whale tongue in Ch 42, pp857-858) 
      - Peripheral vasoconstriction 
    - Locomotor activity
    - Behavioral thermoregulation
     - Clump together when cool to save heat
      - Haul out when warm in Polar Regions
    - Lie in water when warm
      - Sand flipping
  - Ectothermy in aquatic animals (fishes)
    - Fishes’ blood has almost direct contact with their heat-robbing environment—through the gills. So for fishes, this means that using your metabolism to keep warm would be very energetically expensive
Heterothermy is primitive, in the fact that the first vertebrates were (and are) heterotherms
    - However, some species of fishes (fast-swimming fish e.g., tunas and sharks) achieve independent control of temperature in limited parts of the body. Therefore, they are endotherms.
    - These species use a counter-current circulatory system called the rete mirabile (Latin for “wonderful net”), which exchanges venous blood (going to the heart) and arterial blood (going from the heart)-- This minimizes the amount of heat that is lost between the fish’s warm, fast moving extremities and its cooler, slow-moving core. See Barbara Block’s paper on endothermy in fishes.
