"How life works"   


###Important Molecules
Water and other inorganics

*Organics*

- Carbohydrates
- Lipids
- Amino Acids (proteins)
- Nucleotides (nucleic acids)    


Two theories form the framework for modern biological science:     
*The cell theory*     
What are organisms made of?         
*The theory of evolution by natural selection*           
Where do organisms come from?       


In the late 1660s, Robert Hooke and Anton van Leeuwenhoek were the first to observe cells      
A cell is a highly organized compartment     
Bounded by a plasma membrane       
Containing concentrated chemicals in an aqueous solution     
The cell theory states that      
All organisms are made of cells (pattern)     
All cells come from preexisting cells (process)      





Prokaryotes - Eukaryotes - Domains of Life? Plants 

The tree of life indicates three major groups of organisms:         
The eukaryotes        
Eukarya        
Two groups of prokaryotes         
Bacteria and Archaea
