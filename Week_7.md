#17. The endocrine system
- Overview
  - In response to sights, sounds and other sensory stimuli, an animal’s nervous system sends rapid messages, in the form and action potentials, to precise locations in the body
  - In response to changes in external or internal conditions, cells in the CNS or the endocrine system release certain molecules. These molecules produce longer-term responses in a broad range of tissues and organs
  - The endocrine system is a collection of organs and cells that secrete chemical signals into the bloodstream. A chemical signal that circulates through body fluids and affects distant targets cells is called a hormone  
    - A hormone may reach all parts of the body, but only specific target cells respond to specific hormones
    - A given hormone traveling in the bloodstream elicits specific responses from its target cells, while other cell types ignore that particular hormone
    - Hormones are broadcast throughout the body via the bloodstream, but they act only on cells that express the appropriate receptor. Target cells respond to a particular hormone because they contain a receptor for that hormone
    - The presence of an appropriate receptor dictates which cells will respond to a particular hormone (this is key in physiological studies)
 
- Cell-to-cell signaling: An overview (Ch 49, pp 992-997)
  - Major categories of chemical signals (5 types, Ch 49, Summary table 49.1)
    - Autocrine signals: act on the same cell that secretes them
    - Paracrine signals: diffuse locally and act on nearby cells
    - Endocrine signals: are hormones carried between cells by blood or other body fluids
    - Neural signals: diffuse a short distance between neurons (i.e., neurotransmitters)
    - Neuroendocrine signals: are hormones released from neurons (i.e., neurohormones)

- Hormone signaling pathways (3 types, Ch 49, pp 993-994, Figure 49.1)
  - The endocrine system and the nervous system act individually and together in regulating an animal’s physiology
  - Three types of hormone signaling pathways
    - 1. Endocrine pathway (direct from an endocrine cell): hormones are sent directly from endocrine cells to effector cells in response to stimulus-This is found in plants and some animals. There is not involvement of the CNS
  - In most of the cases, information about external or internal conditions is gathered by sensory receptors an then integrated by neurons in the CNS before the production of an hormonal signal
    - 2. Neuroendocrine pathway (direct from the CNS): Neurons in the CNS respond by releasing neuroendocrine signals that act on effector cells directly
    - 3. Neuroendocrine-to-endocrine pathway (CNS-to-endocrine system): Neurons in the CNS respond by releasing neuroendocrine signals that stimulate cells in the endocrine system, which respond by producing a hormone

  - All three types of signaling pathway are regulated by negative and positive feedback inhibition
  - In animal cell-to-cell signaling, feedback inhibition reduces production or secretion of the hormone, or both

- What makes up the endocrine system?
  - Endocrine gland, organs that secrete a hormone into the bloodstream
  - Exocrine gland, organ that deliver secretion through outlets called ducts into a space other than circulatory system

- Chemical characteristics of hormones
  - Three major classes of chemical that can act as hormones in animals
    - Polypeptides
    - Amino acid derivatives
    - Steroids	 
  - Steroids are lipid soluble, while polypeptides and amino acid derivatives are not (with the exception of T3 and T4)- see Figure 49.3 (Ch 49, pp 995)

- What do hormones do? (Ch 49, 997-1003)
  - A single hormone can have multiple functions (e.g., PRL)
  - Different hormones may affect the same aspect of physiology
  - Hormones coordinate the activities of cells the three areas:
    - 1. Development, growth and reproduction
    - 2. Response to environmental challenges (stress)
    - 3. Maintenance of homeostasis
    - Some examples:
      - 1. Development, growth and reproduction 
        - Metamorphosis (we can use examples of flatfishes)
        - Sexual development
      - 2. Response to environmental changes
        - How do hormone coordinate responses to stressors?
          - Short-term response to stress (fight-or-flight): epinephrine or adrenaline
          - Long-term response to stress: cortisol (glucocorticoid)
            - Long-term stress response is a compromise (e.g., reproductive dysfunction in captive fishes)
      - 3. Maintenance of homeostasis
        - Leptin and energy reserved
        - EPO and oxygen availability

- Signal reception (Ch 11, pp210)
  - The presence of an appropriate receptor dictates which cell will respond to a particular hormone
    - Receptors are dynamic 
    - Receptors can be blocked

- Signal processing: how do hormones act on target cells? (Ch 11 pp2010-214; Ch 49, pp 1006-1010)
  - The important point about a signaling molecule is its ability to pass through lipid bilayer  
  - Processing lipid-soluble hormones:
    - When lipid-soluble signals enter a cell, the information they carry is processed directly-without intermediate steps
    - Most lipid-soluble signaling molecules are able to diffuse across the hydrophobic region of the plasma membrane ad enter the cytoplasm of the target cells (Ch 11, pp 211, Figure 11.12)
    - Steroid hormones bind intracellular receptors (see figure 49.15 for steroid hormone action)
    - Steroid hormone-receptors complexes bind to specific sites in DNA called hormone-response elements (ERE) located in the 5’ direction from the start of the target genes
    - Because each hormone-receptor complex leads to the production of many copies of the gene product, the signal form the hormone is amplified
    - Warning: steroid may also mediate rapid non-genomic actions through membrane receptors (see links of interest)

  - Processing lipid-insoluble signals:
    - Large or hydrophilic signaling molecules are lipid insoluble and do not cross the plasma membrane. To affect a target cell, they have to be recognized at the cell surface (Ch 11, pp 211, Figure 11.13)
    - When a signaling molecule binds at the cell surface, it triggers signal transduction –the conversion of a signal from one form to other. A Long and often complex series of events ensues, collectively called a signal transduction pathway
    - The two major types of signal transduction and amplification systems are:
      - Signal transduction via G-protein-coupled receptors
        - When G protein are activated by a signal receptor, they trigger a key step in signal transduction: the production of a messenger inside the cell. They link the receipt of an extracellular signal to the production of an intracellular signal (second messenger, Fig. 11.14, pp 212)
	Examples of second messenger table (Table 11.2, Ch 11, pp 213)

      - Signal transduction via Enzyme-linked receptors
        - Enzyme-linked receptors transduce hormonal signals by directly catalyzing a reaction inside the cell (Fig. 11.15, Ch 11, pp 213)
        
    - Signal transduction pathways form a network. This complexity is important: it allows cells to respond to many different signals in an integrated way (Fig. 11.16, Ch 11 pp215)
    - The same chemical messenger can trigger different responses in cells from different organs or in cells at different developmental stages. The reason for that is that the cells contain different receptors, second messenger, protein kinases, enzymes or transcriptionally active genes (Ch 49, pp 1010)
