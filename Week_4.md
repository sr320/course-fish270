#Circulation and gas exchage (INCOMPLETE)
- Overview
To support continued production of ATP, cells have to obtain oxygen and expel excess of CO2 continuously. Revise concepts from lecture 4 on “Bioenergetics”

- Basic concepts
In general gas exchange involves four steps (Ch 45, pp 903)
1.	Ventilation
2.	Gas exchange in respiratory surface
3.	Circulation
4.	Cellular respiration
Steps 1 and 2 are the respiratory system
Step 3 is the circulatory system
In vertebrates: The circulatory system + Gas exchange organs = Cardiovascular system, (Fig. 45.1, Ch 45, pp. 903)

- This lecture will be divided in two sections
  - The respiratory system
  - The circulatory system

The respiratory system
XXX

- The circulatory system (Ch45, pp. 916-925)
  - Animals without circulatory system
	    - Ways of maximizing the surface area available for diffusion of gases and other solutes 
	    - The 1 mm rule: Diffusion is an effective means of transporting substances (e.g., gases) only when distances is <1 mm
	    - Jellyfish and corals have a large, highly folded gastrovascular cavity –Revise concepts from lecture 6 Nutrition: basic concepts and feeding invertebrates

  - More complex animals have:
    - Open circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp 916-917)
	      - Hemolymph empties into hemocoel and bathes tissue and organs directly
	      - Lack of discrete continuous vessels: Heart-vessel-hemolymph-vessel-heart
 	      - Low pressure, high volume (up to 40% of body mass)
	      - Animal typically has hard shell or exoskeleton
        - Arthropods, most of mollusk but NO cephalopods (fast moving animals, they also have 3 hearts)

  - Close circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp 917-918)
	    - Blood remains in vessels; capillaries allow close contact between blood and tissues
	    - Important advantage: blood can be directed in a precise way in response to the tissues’ needs
	    - High pressure and low volume (5-10% of body mass)
	    - All vertebrates and cephalopods
	
    - Structure and function of blood vessels
		  - Arteries
      - Capillaries
      - Veins
	
- Microcirculation

- The capillary system, interstitial fluid and lymphatic system and their communication
		- Regulation of capillary exchange
			  - Diffusion (most important): difference of gradients, Flick’s law of diffusion
			  - Bulk flow
			  - Transcytosis

- Both circulatory systems have three basic components:
  - A circulatory fluid (blood or hemolymph)
  - A set of “tubes” (blodd vessels)
  - A muscular pump (the heart)
