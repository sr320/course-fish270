#9. Circulation
- Overview:
	- Every organism must exchange materials and energy with its environment, and this exchange ultimately occurs at the cellular level.
	- Cells live in aqueous environments
	- The resources that they need, such as nutrients and oxygen, move across the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm
	- Metabolic wastes, such as carbon dioxide, move out of the cell
	- Most animals have organ systems specialized for exchanging materials with the environment, and many have an internal transport system that conveys fluid (blood or interstitial fluid) throughout the body
	- For aquatic organisms, structures such as gills present an expansive surface area to the outside environment.
	- Oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water diffuses across the thin epithelium covering the gills and into a network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). At the same time, carbon dioxide diffuses out into the water- These two concepts will be addressed in the next lecture.
	- There is a tight connection between circulation (this lecture) and gas exchange (next lecture).

- The circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp. 916-925)
	- Animals WITHOUT circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp 916)
		- Ways of maximizing the surface area available for diffusion of gases and other key solutes 
		- The 1 mm rule: Diffusion is an effective means of transporting substances (e.g., gases) only when distances is <1 mm
		- Cnidarians, planarians, etc. have a large, highly folded gastrovascular cavity –Revise concepts from lecture 6 Nutrition: basic concepts and feeding invertebrates-”
		- For animals with many cell layers, gastrovascular cavities are insufficient for internal distances because the diffusion transports are too great

	- Animals WITH circulatory system
		- Open circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp 916-917)
			- Hemolymph (blood and interstidial fluid) empties into hemocoel and bathes tissue and organs directly
			- Lack of discrete continuous vessels: Heart-vessel-hemolymph-vessel-heart
			- Normally, low pressure and high volume (up to 40% of body mass)
			- Most of invertebrates

		- Close circulatory system (Ch. 45, pp 917-918)
			- Blood remains in vessels; capillaries allow close contact between blood and tissues
			- Important advantage: blood directed in a precise way in response to the tissues’ needs –at any given time, only 5-10% of the body’s capillaries have blood flowing through them
			- High pressure and low volume (5-10% of body mass)
			- All vertebrates and some invertebrates (e.g., annelids, and cephalopods-support intense muscular activity-)
- Basic components of both close and open circulatory systems
	- Muscular bomb/s (heart)
	- Vessels
	- Circulatory fluid

- Types of blood vessels: arteries, capillaries and veins (Ch 45, pp 917-918)
- The capillary system, interstitial fluid and lymphatic system and their communication (Ch 45, pp 918-919)
- Exchange of substance between the blood and the interstitial fluid that bathes the tissues.

	 - Mechanism:
		- Diffusion- Fick’s law (see Ch. 45 pp 905-906)
		- Bulk flow- Starling’s and concept of microcirculation law (see Ch 45, pp 919, Fig. 45.21)
			- Filtration (Hydrostatic pressure > Osmotic pressure) 
			- Reabsorption (Hydrostatic pressure < Osmotic pressure)
		- Transcytosis (exocytosis and endocytosis)

- Metabolic rate is an important factor in the evolution of cardiovascular systems.
	- In general, animals with high metabolic rates have more complex circulatory systems and more powerful hearts than animals with low metabolic rates.
	- Similarly, the complexity and number of blood vessels in a particular organ are correlated with that organ’s metabolic requirements. 
	- Perhaps the most fundamental differences in cardiovascular adaptations are associated with gill breathing in aquatic vertebrates compared with lung breathing in terrestrial vertebrates.

- The heart (Ch 45, pp 919-925)
	- Evolution of the circulatory system: Vertebrate phylogeny is reflected in adaptations of the cardiovascular system (Ch 45, pp 920, Fig. 45.22), see links of interest -surveying animal circulatory systems-
		- Single-loop circulation (e.g., fishes, see below)
		- Double-loop circulation (higher vertebrates)
			- Amphibians (oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor mix in the ventricle)
			- Non-bird reptiles (partial septum)
			- Crocodilians, birds and mammals (complete septum). Advantages.

- Circulatory system in fishes: key concepts 
	- A fish heart has two main chambers, one atrium and one ventricle
	- Blood is pumped from the ventricle to the gills (the gill circulation) where it picks up oxygen and disposes of carbon dioxide across the capillary walls
	- The gill capillaries converge into a vessel that carries oxygenated blood to capillary beds in the other organs (the systemic circulation) and back via veins to the atrium of the heart
	- In fish, blood must pass through two capillary beds, the gill capillaries and systemic capillaries
	- When blood flows through a capillary bed, blood pressure—the motive force for circulation—drops substantially
	- Therefore, oxygen-rich blood leaving the gills flows to the systemic circulation quite slowly (although the process is aided by body movements during swimming)
	- This constrains the delivery of oxygen to body tissues and, hence, the maximum aerobic metabolic rate of fishes


- Blood (Ch 42, pp846-847 and Ch45 pp 912)
	- In invertebrates with open circulatory system: hemolymph is not different from interstitial fluid
	- In vertebrates:  specialized connective tissue consisting of several kinds of cells suspended in a liquid matrix called plasma
	- Blood composition
		- Plasma (water, dissolved proteins, ions, waste products, respiratory gases, hormones, etc.)
		- Blood cells:
			- Platelets (thrombocytes)		
			- White (leukocytes)
			- Red (erythrocytes)-Introduce next lecture
