#7. FEEDING IN VERTEBRATES

- Note: Because we haven’t talked much about fishes and vertebrates in this class, I think we should introduce some important facts.
- Overview:
  - In this lecture we are going to focus on fishes.
  - Fish are the largest phylum of living vertebrates, with around 34,000 fish species out of approximately 50,000 vertebrate species (www.fishbase.com, as of August 2015) -That is more than the combined total of all other vertebrate species: mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds.
  - Fishes inhabit almost every aquatic environment on the planet, presenting an enormous variation in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and other chemical and physical water properties – we will see this in subsequent lectures.
  - Fishes have also adapted different modes of feeding: Modes of feeding attending to two different criteria: “what animal eat” and “how animal feed”-Review concepts from last lecture.
  - Overall, fishes (as well as other vertebrates), have an alimentary tract that comprises the same basic components: oral cavity (mouth), stomach, intestine and rectum, which serve to ingest and digest food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate undigested material- Review concepts from last lecture .
  - However, there are some important considerations in fishes –This is taken from “Fish Nutrition in Aquaculture” by S.S. de Silva, T.A. Anderson. Examples:
    - Presence/absence of stomach
    - Length of intestine
