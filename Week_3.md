#7. FEEDING IN VERTEBRATES

- Note: Because we haven’t talked much about fishes and vertebrates in this class, I think we should introduce some important facts.
- Overview:
  - In this lecture we are going to focus on fishes.
  - Fish are the largest phylum of living vertebrates, with around 34,000 fish species out of approximately 50,000 vertebrate species (www.fishbase.com, as of August 2015) -That is more than the combined total of all other vertebrate species: mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds.
  - Fishes inhabit almost every aquatic environment on the planet, presenting an enormous variation in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and other chemical and physical water properties – we will see this in subsequent lectures.
  - Fishes have also adapted different modes of feeding: Modes of feeding attending to two different criteria: “what animal eat” and “how animal feed”-Review concepts from last lecture.
  - Overall, fishes (as well as other vertebrates), have an alimentary tract that comprises the same basic components: oral cavity (mouth), stomach, intestine and rectum, which serve to ingest and digest food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate undigested material- Review concepts from last lecture .
  - However, there are some important considerations in fishes –This is taken from “Fish Nutrition in Aquaculture” by S.S. de Silva, T.A. Anderson. Examples:
    - Presence/absence of stomach
    - Length of intestine
    
We will divide this lecture in these main sections:
- Oral cavity (jaw, teeth, pharyngeal jaw and gill rakers)
- Stomach (gizzard and stomach)
- Piloric caeca
- Intestine (intestine and spiral valve)
- Rectum

- Jaw
  - Jawless fish (Ch 35, pp. 697)
    - Cyclostomes (“round mouth”, or agnathans): hagfish and lampreys
    - Do not have jaw-only jawless vertebrates
    - Most primitive group of fishes
    - Their mouths cannot close due to the lack of a jaw, so they have to constantly cycle water through the mouth. 
    - Interesting fact: some hagfish can absorb nutrients through their skin- See links of interest. 

  - Jawed fish 
    - Gnathostomes: chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) and osteichthyes (bony fishes)
    - The evolution of jaws allowed gnathostomes to become effective predators and accounted for much of their subsequent success
    - Gill-arch hypothesis: mutation and natural selection increased the size of the most anterior arch and modified its orientation, producing the first working jaw (Ch 35, pp 692). 

- Teeth
  - Similar to other animals, fish have evolved to have different types of teeth depending on their diets. Examples: 
  - Other facts:
    - Most of sharks and rays, as well as other predator fishes, have polyphyodont teeth- teeth are continually replaced as they wear out or are lost. When a tooth or some teeth need to be replaced the gum moves forward pulling the new teeth both forward and erect
    - In other predator fishes the new teeth grow either at the base of the old teeth, or in between the old teeth when these teeth are not too closely packed.

- Pharyngeal jaw
  - Located in the back of the throat and makes food processing particularly efficient. A case study: The cichlid jaw, Ch 44, pp 884-886.

- Gill rakers
  - Bony or cartilaginous processes that project from the branchial arch (gill arch) and are involved with suspension feeding tiny prey
  - The structure and spacing of gill rakers in fish determines the size of food particles trapped, and correlates with feeding behavior. 
  - Fish with densely spaced, elongated, comb-like gill rakers are efficient at filtering tiny prey, whereas carnivores and omnivores often have more widely spaced gill rakers with secondary projections
  
- Gizzard (see avian gizzard in Ch 44, pp 891-892)
  - Found in relatively few fish species
  - The gizzard is a highly muscular modification of the first part of the stomach. It grinds up coarse food items into smaller pieces thus facilitating their later digestion. 
  - In those fish which have a gizzard (e.g., mullet or shad) it is the place where digestion begins because as well as its muscular activity the gizzard also secretes digestive enzymes into the food

- Stomach (Ch 44, pp 889-892)
  - The stomach of fish is less well delineated than it is in the higher vertebrates, and in some cases it is considered to be absent. 
  - Fish WITHOUT stomach 
    - Approximately a quarter of fishes do not have stomach.
    - This loss does not appear to impose dietary constraints. Stomach-less fishes cover the entire trophic spectrum (i.e., herbivores, omnivores, detritivores and carnivores). This is also observed in the platypus. Note: all the stomach-less animal live in the water. See a very interesting reading: How the platypus and a quarter of fishes lost their stomach, from National Geographic, in links of interest.
    - For more information, read enzymatic digestion in stomach-less fishes: “How a simple gut accommodates both herbivory and carnivory”, in links of interest.

  - Fish WITH stomach
    - Where a true stomach is found to exist it is a muscular bag, or tube with a highly acidic internal environment.
    - All pure predators have stomach: Large stomach in carnivorous, and small stomach in herbivorous and omnivorous: digestion of proteins
    - Function of pepsins
	    - Pepsinogen (zymogen) and pepsin
      - Need of an acidic environment in the stomach 
	    - In fishes gastric acid (composed by HCl) and pepsinogen are secreted from the so-called  oxynticopeptic cells
      - In most fish the pH of the stomach varies between 2 and 4. See the optimum PH to activate pepsin in a number of fish species at: http://www.omicsonline.org/extraction-purification-and-characterization-of-fish-pepsin-a-critical-review-2157-7110.1000126.pdf
    - Curiosity about versatility of stomachs- The black swallower feeds on bony fishes, which are swallowed whole. With its greatly distensible stomach, it is capable of swallowing prey over twice its length and 10 times its mass

- Piloric caeca
  - Organ with fingerlike projections is located near the junction of the stomach and the intestines
  - It secretes trypsin and enzymes active in the intestines, it is also considered likely that they are important in neutralizing the acidity of the chyme (i.e., mixture of gastric juices, digesta and mucus) before it reaches the intestines, where the environment is alkaline in contrast to the stomachs acidity
- It is possible that the pyloric caeca play a fuller or more complex role in the digestive cycle in some groups of fish than they do in others

- Intestine (Ch 44, pp 892-897)
  - The intestine is a long thin tube with a thin double layer musculature, the outer layer being longitudinal and the inner layer being circular. 
  - It is the sight of the final digestion and absorption of the food a fish eats. 
  - Intestines become longer as the diet moves through being carnivorous to omnivorous to detritivorous to herbivorous. 
    - Carnivorous, have fairly short intestines because such food is easy to chemically break down and digest. 
    - Herbivorous, require longer intestines because plant matter is usually tough and fibrous and more difficult to break down into usable components.
