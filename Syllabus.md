Syllabus

1. **Description**FISH 270: Aquatic EcophysiologyThis course will teach fundamental aspects of biological form and function with an emphasis on highlighting the profound differences and similarities across taxa. The first half of the course will focus on primary physiological process including energy metabolism, thermal biology, osmoregulation, and immune function. During the second half of the course we will apply the principles to specific case studies that are environment specific as we transition through terrestrial habitat, open ocean, coastal estuaries, polar and tropical ecosystems, and deep ocean. The laboratory section will reinforce principles from each week’s lecture content and will consist of live organism experiments, field trips, and computer simulations.

2. **Objectives**This class aims to provide you with an understanding of basic physiological process and the ability to apply this knowledge to understand how diverse taxa, ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, live in diverse and changing environments. Specific goals are:• Describe how essential life processes (growth, reproduction) work and thecommon and unique challenges organisms face in different environments.• Discriminate similarities and difference across taxa at the physiological level.• Develop quantitative reasoning and skills in physiology and in biology in general• Apply physiological principles to determine how a variety of organisms functionin different aquatic environments.• Synthesize scientific principles by effectively searching primary literature,collating information and presenting knowledge in a succinct fashion.• Work collaboratively to reach solutions• Assist the advancement of knowledge by evaluating peer contributions.• Apply the use of microscopes and lab equipment in investigation in physiological experiments.

4. Meeting TimesLectures MWF 50 minutes Lab M 1:30-4:20

5. Required TextbookBiological Science – Publisher Benjamin Cummings – Authors: Freeman, Quillin, Allison

6. Online ResourcesWe have set up a Canvas website that will be used to disseminate resources for the class. To access materials you will need your UW NetID. Lectures notes will be uploaded prior to each lecture. A discussion board on the Canvas site will be used as a primary means of communication.

8. Other PoliciesAttendanceStudents are individually responsible for all information presented in lectures, and readings. No make-up exams will be allowedAcademic ConductPassing anyone else’s scholarly work (which can include written material, exam answers, graphics or other images, and even ideas) as your own, without proper attribution, is considered academic misconduct. Anyone engaging in academic misconduct will not receive credit for the course.

9. Disability statementIt is crucial that all students in this class have access to the full range of learning experiences. At the University of Washington, it is the policy and practice to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.Full participation in this course requires the following types of engagement:Course Component Requirement(s)Lecture The ability to attend tri-weekly lectures of 50 minutes with 150 other students. The ability to complete weekly in-classonline quizzes of 3-6 questionsLab The ability to attend weekly 80 minute labs with 25 other students. The ability to work with other students, dissectorganisms, and go on one field trip that will consist of walking on flat, possibly muddy terrain.If you anticipate or experience barriers to your learning or full participation in this course based on a physical, learning, or mental health disability, please immediately contact the instructor to discuss possible accommodation(s). A more complete description of the disability policy of the College of the Environment can befound here. If you have, or think you have, a temporary or permanent disability that impacts your participation in any course, please also contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at: 206-543-8924 V / 206-543-8925 TDD / uwdss@uw.edu e- mail / http://www.uw.edu/students/drs.
